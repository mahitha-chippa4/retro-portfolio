# 🖥️ Mahitha’s Retro OS Portfolio

A pixel-perfect, retro-inspired web portfolio built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** — bringing the charm of vintage operating systems to life in the browser.

## 📍 Overview

This portfolio recreates the experience of using an old-school operating system: draggable desktop icons, pixel UI, windowed apps, playful animations, and a nostalgic taskbar — all powered by modern web technologies.
